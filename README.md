# Project Holmes Security Toolbox

#####The intention of this project is to develop a program that will decode a password submitted by a user. The program will reference a library of common passwords for increased efficiency (efficiency beyond that of a pure brute force method alone).  The program will also provide feedback on increasing the passwordâ€™s strength. These user interactions will require the use of a graphical user interface.  The program will also be able to encrypt messages for transmission, and decrypt both received and intercepted messages (using slightly different techniques).
